# Answers on questions

1) The MVC architectural pattern was used, since native libraries are used inside the application, Apple advises us to use MVC, but as usual, this pattern was chosen due to time, so there is a lot of unnecessary logic inside View Controllers.

2) I would change the architecture of the application, for example, to MVVM, in order to remove dependencies on other services, I would devote more time to animation. I would also add tests.

3) Structured code, highlighting code blocks in MARK, deployment of optionals, availability of protocols.
